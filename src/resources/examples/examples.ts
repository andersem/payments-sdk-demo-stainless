     * ### configuration.channel=in_app
     *
     * The `in_app` channel is intended for payments done from mobile devices where
     * `url.return_url` can be set to the application's appswitch URL.
     *
     * If the query-param `?initial_recipient=merchant` is appended to the appswitch
     * URL, the payment app will redirect directly to the app, without proxying through
     * Dintero.
     *
     * In that case, the `transaction_id` will be appended to the `return_url`, and you
     * will need to poll [GET /v1/transactions](#operation/transactions_get) with this
     * id until the transaction has been updated with one of these statuses:
     *
     * - AUTHORIZED
     * - CAPTURED
     * - FAILED
     *
     * Example url:
     * `myapp://?initial_recipient=merchant&transaction_id=T12345678.abc&merchant_reference=mref123&session_id=T12345678.abd`
     */
    return_url: string;

    /**
     * URL that Checkout will call when the session payment is complete and the
     * transaction has been authorized.
     *
     * > **Callback is only delivered to HTTPS URLs**
     *
     * > A callback done with a transaction with status `ON_HOLD` will receive an
     * > aditional callback (later) when the transaction state changes status from
     * > `ON_HOLD`.
     *
     * > The callback may be received after the transaction is `CAPTURED` in case when
     * > the transaction was created from a session where `auto_capture` was enabled.
     *
     * Unlike the `return_url` the `callback_url` is system-to-system which means
     * delivery is guaranteed.
     *
     * Once a session payment is complete the callback_url is invoked as a `GET`
     * request to notify your system that the payment has been approved.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `method=POST` query parameter will be invoked as a `POST`
     *   request with the transaction included in the request body.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `report_error=true` will enable the callback_url to be
     *   called if the payment failed with error `cancelled`, `authorization` or
     *   `failed`.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `delay_callback=<seconds>` will delay the callback before
     *   trying to deliver the callback. The **maximum** delay is 60 seconds.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `report_event={EVENT}` will enable the callback_url to be
     *   called if a payment event has been applied to the transaction. Valid values
     *   are `CAPTURE`, `REFUND` and `VOID`. The callback_url can contain multiple
     *   `report_event` query parameters. An `event` query parameter will be included
     *   in the request sent to the callback_url.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `includes=session` will enable the callback_url to include
     *   the session data in the body.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `sid_parameter_name=sid` will change the query param
     *   `session_id` to `sid` to avoid false session fixation alarms in firewalls.
     *   Possible values: `sid`, `session_id`
     *
     * A successful delivery to an HTTPS callback_url sometimes requires more than one
     * attempt. This can be the case, for example, if the server hosting the
     * callback_url is down for maintenance or is experiencing heavy traffic.
     *
     * Dintero attempts a retry only after a failed delivery attempt, following
     * situations is considered as failed delivery
     *
     * - HTTP status code 100 to 101 and 500 to 599 (inclusive) (HTTP status code 400
     *   to 499 is considered as permanent failure)
     * - A request timeout (10 seconds)
     * - Any connection error such as connection timeout, bad certificate, etc
     *
     * Failed delivery will be retried 20 times.

     * ### configuration.channel=in_app
     *
     * The `in_app` channel is intended for payments done from mobile devices where
     * `url.return_url` can be set to the application's appswitch URL.
     *
     * If the query-param `?initial_recipient=merchant` is appended to the appswitch
     * URL, the payment app will redirect directly to the app, without proxying through
     * Dintero.
     *
     * In that case, the `transaction_id` will be appended to the `return_url`, and you
     * will need to poll [GET /v1/transactions](#operation/transactions_get) with this
     * id until the transaction has been updated with one of these statuses:
     *
     * - AUTHORIZED
     * - CAPTURED
     * - FAILED
     *
     * Example url:
     * `myapp://?initial_recipient=merchant&transaction_id=T12345678.abc&merchant_reference=mref123&session_id=T12345678.abd`
     */
    return_url: string;

    /**
     * URL that Checkout will call when the session payment is complete and the
     * transaction has been authorized.
     *
     * > **Callback is only delivered to HTTPS URLs**
     *
     * > A callback done with a transaction with status `ON_HOLD` will receive an
     * > aditional callback (later) when the transaction state changes status from
     * > `ON_HOLD`.
     *
     * > The callback may be received after the transaction is `CAPTURED` in case when
     * > the transaction was created from a session where `auto_capture` was enabled.
     *
     * Unlike the `return_url` the `callback_url` is system-to-system which means
     * delivery is guaranteed.
     *
     * Once a session payment is complete the callback_url is invoked as a `GET`
     * request to notify your system that the payment has been approved.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `method=POST` query parameter will be invoked as a `POST`
     *   request with the transaction included in the request body.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `report_error=true` will enable the callback_url to be
     *   called if the payment failed with error `cancelled`, `authorization` or
     *   `failed`.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `delay_callback=<seconds>` will delay the callback before
     *   trying to deliver the callback. The **maximum** delay is 60 seconds.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `report_event={EVENT}` will enable the callback_url to be
     *   called if a payment event has been applied to the transaction. Valid values
     *   are `CAPTURE`, `REFUND` and `VOID`. The callback_url can contain multiple
     *   `report_event` query parameters. An `event` query parameter will be included
     *   in the request sent to the callback_url.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `includes=session` will enable the callback_url to include
     *   the session data in the body.
     *
     * - A callback_url with `sid_parameter_name=sid` will change the query param
     *   `session_id` to `sid` to avoid false session fixation alarms in firewalls.
     *   Possible values: `sid`, `session_id`
     *
     * A successful delivery to an HTTPS callback_url sometimes requires more than one
     * attempt. This can be the case, for example, if the server hosting the
     * callback_url is down for maintenance or is experiencing heavy traffic.
     *
     * Dintero attempts a retry only after a failed delivery attempt, following
     * situations is considered as failed delivery
     *
     * - HTTP status code 100 to 101 and 500 to 599 (inclusive) (HTTP status code 400
     *   to 499 is considered as permanent failure)
     * - A request timeout (10 seconds)
     * - Any connection error such as connection timeout, bad certificate, etc
     *
     * Failed delivery will be retried 20 times.
